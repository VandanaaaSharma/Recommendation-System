# Recommendation-System
Overview
This project implements a movie recommender system using Python and Streamlit. The system provides movie recommendations based on a selected movie title by leveraging a similarity algorithm. It uses the TMDb (The Movie Database) API to fetch movie posters and display them in a user-friendly interface.
Features
Movie Selection: Users can select a movie from a dropdown list.
Movie Recommendations: Get a list of recommended movies based on the selected movie.
Movie Posters: Display posters of the recommended movies fetched from TMDb API.
Streamlit Interface: An interactive web interface for users to interact with the recommender system.
Data
The system uses the following datasets:

TMDb 5000 Movies Dataset: This dataset includes movie metadata such as genres, keywords, cast, and crew, which are used to build the recommendation model.

TMDb 5000 Credits Dataset: Contains additional movie credit information, which is merged with the movies dataset to enhance recommendation accuracy.

Dataset Source: Both datasets can be found on Kaggle:
